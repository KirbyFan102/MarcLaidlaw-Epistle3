# Epistolary Afterthoughts

Tweeted by Marc Laidlaw on August 27th. Archiving this because it's a nice addition to Marc's Epistle3 blog entry.


The corrected version includes the same name corrections as Epistle3_Corrected. Except following:

"Bernadette"                     : "Barney"

"cAT"                            : "D0g"

"Green Valley Science Factory"   : "Black Mesa Research Facility"
