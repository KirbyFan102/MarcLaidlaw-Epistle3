# Epistolary Afterthoughts:
The map is not the territory. A sketch is only a starting point. Everything changes as you try to make it real...

Everyone who works on it will have ideas, and new opportunities will appear and change everything...

But even on a story level, you will find as you get closer that some things just won't work. Would Alex really shoot and kill Jerry Maas?...

Is that too harsh? What if Alex pushed Jerry into a timeloop or portal bubble instead, leaving his fate open?...

Is there a role in all this for the former security guard Bernadette? What about cAT?...

What if the final explosion powers a huge timeloop singularity that puts Gertrude back on the Green Valley Science Factory Inbound Train...

...and it all never happened? ...or is about to happen again?

Also, how do you tell it? Do you start on the Hyperborea and have physical timeloops that function as flashbacks? How would that work?

Do you start with glimpses of a Dispar interrogation cell? Do you hint the entire experience is provoked fantasy as a means of getting info?

Or is a straightforward linear experience the most satisfying? It takes a team to work this stuff out. Vignettes are easy.

And then what do you do if the brilliant actress who plays Wanda Bree...dies?
